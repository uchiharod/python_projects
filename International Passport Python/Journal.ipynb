    "Data Types - Week 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 What are Data Types?\n",
    "Data Types are a categorisation of the type of data we are storing.\n",
    "As Data Types define the type of a Variable (Check Variable section), we must think about what kind of data we want to store inside our Variable.\n",
    "So during class, in the case of Data Type Strings for example we would be storing Text and for Data Type Numbers we would be storing numeric values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way I think about it to simplify it is I know that a computer stores Data in its MEMORY. The Data stored in memory can be of many different types right? So a person's age for example is stored as a numeric value and his or her addresses are stored as alpha numeric characters “String”\n",
    "\n",
    "For us to build code in Python we must have an understanding of the different Data Types. These Data Types range from the following.\n",
    "•\tNumbers\n",
    "•\tStrings\n",
    "•\tBooleans (true or false data / values\n",
    "•\tLists\n",
    "•\tTuples\n",
    "•\tDictionaries etc\n",
    "The ones we touched on in class are \n",

    "1.1.1 Diagram of different data Types in Python\n",
    " \n",
    "1.1.1 Different Data Types in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagram 1.1.1 is just to understand the different classifications of Data Types (NOT SHOWN IN CLASS). In class we only covered Floats and Integers. Floats are numbers with decimals, and Integers are whole numbers as “IP” explained.\n",
    "Also the above Data Types are the standard built in Data Types that come with Python when we did our Installation during the first lesson.\n",
    " \n",
    "1.1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.2.1 What are Strings?\n",
    "Strings are basically plain text data made up of alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "It is important to bear in mind that stings must have quotation marks at the beginning as well as the end. (“”) (‘’).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both double or single quotation marks can be used. (Refer to Screenshot 3.2.2 Lab 2 Writing my first string)\n",
    "\n",
    "USE ONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU FELLAS!\n",
    " \n",
    "1.1.3 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.3.1 What are Numbers?\n",
    "Numbers in Python refer to numeric Data Types. As shown above these Data Types are Integer, Float, Boolean, and Complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class today we did 2 tasks working with numbers\n",
    "•\tTask 1: Storing numbers in Variable containers. (Refer to Variable section)\n",
    "•\tTask 2: Playing with number functions. (Refer to Functions Understanding Functions section 3.4.1)\n",
    " \n",
    "2 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 What are Comments?\n",
    "Comments is used to document code, which explains the code in a structured cohesive fashion. Essentially making it easy for other developers to read and understand what your code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments don't form any part of the codes output and starts with a #\n",
    "\n",
    "#I saw Keisha on my flight to Mexico.\n",
    " \n",
    "3 Functions (Understanding Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 What are Functions?\n",
    "When we want to perform a specific task, the piece of code that we use to achieve this is a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1.1 What are Python built in Functions?\n",
    "These are standard library function s built within Python that can be used directly in our program like print()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1.2 What are User-defined Functions?\n",
    "These are functions we define ourselves to do a certain specific task. This will be touched on in future classes\n",
    "In class today we will use the print() function, the str() function and numerous number functions.\n",
    " \n",
    "3.2 Print function print()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2.1 What is a print() function?\n",

    " 3.2.2 My first string Lab 2\n",
    " \n",
    "3.3 String function str()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3.1 What is a str() function?\n",
    "str() function is an inbuilt function, that converts values to a string form, so they can be combined with other strings.\n",
    "The str() function comes in handy when we want to print out numbers alongside strings\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4 Number functions abs(), power(), max(), min(), round()\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous number functions that can be used with numeric Data Types. As “IP” mentioned these are inbuilt in Python upon installation. The ones we worked on in class are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4.1 Various Number functions worked on in class (Task 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tABS - prints the absolute value of a number abs()\n",
    "•\tPOWER – allows you to pass two pieces of numerical data to get the power of\n",
    "•\tMAX function – gives you the highest number you put in brackets\n",
    "•\tMIN function – opposite of Max\n",
    "•\tRound function – rounds the number up\n",
    "•\tImport statement – used to import other math functions to use (from math import *)\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.1 What is abs() function?\n",
    "The abs() function returns the absolute value of a number, essentially it's how far that number is from 0. \n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.1 abs() function Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Lab 4 Numbers example our Variable my_num contains the numerical Data Type value of -10 we then use the print() function to print the absolute value of the number stored  within the Variable container and we get an output of 10 which is how far -10 is from 0. \n",
    "Be aware that the absolute value will always be a positive value. So when it comes to calculating the absolute value of a negative number the result will always be a positive version of that number, hence why in our example the output is 10.\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.2 What is the pow() function?\n",
    "The pow() function allows you to calculate the power a number given the parameters.\n",
    " 3.4.1.2 pow() function Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Lab 4 Number, here the parameters we pass are 3,and 3. So 3 to the power of 3 is 27 as you can see in the output.\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.3 What is the max() function?\n",
    "The max() function returns the item with the highest value\n",
    "\n",
    " 3.4.1.3 max() function Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Lab the item with the highest value is 101, The max() function passes 2 parameters 100 and 101 and the print() prints out the result which can be seen in the output.\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.4 What is the min() function?\n",
    "This is the opposite of max() function it returns the item with the lowest value.\n",
    " 3.4.1.4 min() function Lab 4\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.5 What is the round() function?\n",
    "The round() function returns a rounded number\n",
    " 3.4.1.5 round() function Lab 4\n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.1.6 Import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the import statement to import other functions in Python. With import math * statement we import other math functions different from the inbuilt ones we have used previously.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3.4.1.6 Import statement Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Lab 4 Numbers example we import the sqrt() function using the import statement. We use the print() function to print out the square root of 50. Also if you omitt the statement and try to use the sqrt() function you will get an error.\n",
    " \n",
    "4 Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 What is a Variable?\n",
    "A Variable is kind of a container that can store our Data Type values.\n",
    "In class we learnt how to write our first Variable Lab 3 and after storing numbers in Variables. Task 1 Lab 4\n",
    " 4.1 writing my first Variable Lab 3\n",
    "In our Lab 3 example our variable is my_str and my_str2. We have a string contained within that Variable, which we call with our print() function, print(my_str) and print(my_str2).\n",
    " \n",
    " 4.1 Storing numbers within a variable Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the my_num Variable we store the Data Value number 50. Notice that if we enclose it within quotes “50” Python will recognise it as a string whereas 50 is recognised as a number. We then call the Variable with the print() function to get our output of 50.\n",
    " \n",
    "5 + Operator (Concatenate)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1 What is an Operator?\n",
    "Operators in Python are special characters used for a specific operation. They are often used to link several operands (values/data) to form a new value.\n",
    "In class we used the + Operator which is called a concatenation Operator. This allows us to combine or concatenate two or more character strings into a single character string.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Input function - Week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 What is an Input function?\n",
    "The input() function is a built in Python function that allows user input. Note that the input given by the user will be taken as a string in Python, irrespective of the type of input the user gives.\n",
    "We use the input() function to take input from the user in order to get an output, what we put in must result in an output.\n",
    " 1.1.1 input function Lab 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code we declare a variable called name. We then create our input function with a string (”Enter Your Name To Start Game: “) this string is contained within the variable name. Next our print function concatenates the string “Hello” with our variable name. This presents and allows the user to input their name .\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.1.2 Adding to our input function Lab 2\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code it follows our first lab although now adding 2 input() functions into 2 different variables, name and level respectively. We then go on to print out these using the print() function allowing the user to input there name  and level. The print() function calls the variables allowing the program to print the name and level in the output concatenating the string “Hello” with the users name, “You are at level”, and level input.\n",

    "2. Building a basic calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Using what we know from the input section, we created a basic calculator. \n",
    "•\tInt – Whole numbers\n",
    "•\tFloat – Decimal numbers\n",
    " \n",
    "2.1 What is an Int() function?\n",
    "Int is a built in function that converts a string value into an integer (Whole number)\n",
    " 2.1.1 Building a calculator using the input function to add two whole numbers together using the int function Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from our code we use an input() function to allow the user to input, which is contained within our variables number1 and number2. To extend this we use the int() function to add the whole numbers the user inputs. The result variable contains the int(number1) + int(number2) that the user inputs. And we can see that 5 + 5 = 10 in our code output using the print() function.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2.1.2 Building a calculator using the input function to add two whole numbers together using the int() function Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the above code it slightly varies from 2.2.1 Lab 3, as it concatenates 2 strings together. So instead of the output 2 + 2 = 4, we instead get 22\n",
    " \n",
    "2.2 What is a float() function?\n",
    "Float is a built in function that converts a string into a decimal or fractional number.\n",
    " 2.2.1 Building a calculator using the input function to add two decimal numbers together using the float() function Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code the layout is pretty much the same as the int() function Labs, however this time were using the float() function. You can see by the output that the input returns a float as a decimal number. In this case 4.0.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Using the input function to rate a user’s mood\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the input() function to rate a users day.\n",
    " 3.1.1 Using the input() function to rate a user’s mood Lab 5\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the above code, we declare a variable named day_rating. We pass an input() argument returning whatever the user inputs as their mood. And we can see this further when our print() function concatenates the string “You feel like a” with the day_rating variable and “Thanks for letting me know”. If you can notice from our previous Lab examples we put a string within the input() function, if we were to do that here it would have output whatever we put inside the function. So instead we used the print() function to output whatever we wanted to say to the user.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Complex input() function example \n",
    "We ended the class with a complex input() function example.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4.1.1 Complex input() function example\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code here we are creating a sort of application form for user input, with variable name, mother_maiden_name, email, and address declared. Our input functions for each have a string which are contained within the Variable respectively.\n",
    "We then go on to use a print() function concatenating the stings like “Your name:” with name which is the input() function result, input by the user. These print() functions are used in this example for the user to verify their input details before proceeding to the next stage of the application. \n",

    "1. Lists - Week 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 What is a List?\n",
    "A list is essentially just a structure you can use to store lists of information. It is a type of container in Python used to store multiple datasets at the same time.\n",
    "Lists are stored in square brackets []. The square brackets tells Python that you are working on a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In work you’ll be dealing with different amounts of data. When dealing with this you want to make sure that you can manage data properly.\n",
    " \n",
    "1.2 Printing out specific elements from your lists\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at our lists which consist of elements, each of these elements have a particular numeric index.\n",
    "The standard numeric index in Python start at 0 when it comes to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets Lab\n",
    " \n",
    "1.2.1 Creating our first list Lab 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code as mentioned earlier lists are contained within square brackets, and in this example our list is contained within the Variable “anime”. Just like strings lists are also Data Types which get passed to our Variables we create. Just like previous examples we call our Variable using the print() function and this outputs the contents inside the square bracket in our output.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "1.2.2 Printing out a specific element or value from the list Lab 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is almost identical to our first lab with the exception of printing out the particular element with the index of [1]. As mentioned earlier, standard numeric index in Python always starts from 0. so in this example “Naruto” is 0, “Shingeki” is 1, “Bleach” is 2, and “Hashuko” is 3. according to the Python indexing schema we chose [1] so “Shingeki” is the element output because the element indexes to 1 in the list.\n",
    " \n",
    "Conversely if we wanted to print out the element “Naruto” we would use 0. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "1.2.3 Printing out a specific element or value from the list Lab 2.1\n",

    "1.3 Selecting multiple elements from our list \n",
    "\n",
    " 1.3.1 Selecting multiple elements from our list Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the code the portion we wanted to select is from index [3] so the output is “Hashuko” and “Dragon Ball”.\n",

    "1.4 Specifying a range to print out in the list\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "1.4.1 Specifying a range to print out in the list Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from our code the end or last index is not included. [0:3] where start index is 0 and end index is 3 is what we included in our code to specify the range from “Naruto” to “Bleach”. Conversely if we wanted our range to start from “Shingeki No Kyojin” to “Bleach” we would use [1:3] as our start and end index.\n",

    "1.5 modifying a value in the list and updating it\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.5.1 Modifying a value in the list and updating it Lab 5\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from our code we have modified the “Hashuko” element which is index 3 and updated it with a new element “Slam Dunk”. We use the print() function to print out specifically our new “Slam Dunk” element, whhic has updated our 3rd index element from the list “Hashuko”\n",
    " \n",
    " 1.5.2 Modifying a value in the list and updating it Lab 5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous lab specifically printed out the new element we modified, this code now shows or outputs the new updated list with “Slam Dunk” the 3rd index in place of “Hashuko” as modified.\n",

    "1.6 Concatenate multiple lists together using the + operator\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.6.1 Concatenate multiple lists together using the + operator Lab 6\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code we create 3 different variables called list1, list2, and list3. These Variables contain numbers. We then created a Variable called countdown calling the list Variables created concatenating the lists. We then use the print() function calling the countdown Variable, which prints all the concatenated lists.\n",

    "1.7 Using the * operator, which can be used for repetition in a list, to duplicate elements\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.7.1 using the * operator, which can be used for repetition in a list, to duplicate elements Lab 7\n",
    "\n",
    "This code shows a typical example of when you might want to repeat or duplicate some elements from a list. In the code we cerate a Variable called list3 with “Becky” in the list. Lets say you wanted to duplicate “Becky” 100 times it would be tedious to do so. So you can basically use code to automate this. To do this we use the print() function to print out our list3 Variable which in this case is “Becky” and use the * operator by 10 to output “Becky” 10 times.\n",

    "2.1 What is a Nested list?\n",
    "A nested list is a list inside of a list. With a nested list you can access the elements using the [row] [column] variable notation.\n",

    "Lets Lab\n",
    " 2.1.1 Nested list example Lab 8\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see here we declare a  z variable which contains the nested list. Inside the list contained in z there are 2 lists. Together they are called nested lists. Inside the print() function we call z. z contains the nested list. The square brackets refers to the nested list. Using the indexing in Python we can see that we have 2 rows, row 0 and row 1. we want to print the 0 index of the 1st row index meaning 0 would be (1,2,3) and 1 would be (4,5,6). So therefore we are looking at the nested list containing (4,5,6) and within this list we want 0 index which is 4 as seen in the output\n",
