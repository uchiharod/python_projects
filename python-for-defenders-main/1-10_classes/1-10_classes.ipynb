    "Computers don't know anything. At the very base, a computer is only good at detecting the presence or absence of electicity. Everything else is just layers of abstraction above that. But that's not how people think about the universe, and modern programming languages have concepts that seek to more closely align computer mechanics with human thought. That's what objects are.\n",

This is the function that will take in arguments and produce an **instance** of the class. In Python, the constructor function is `__init__()`. Yes, those are 2 underscores on either side of `init`. This pattern is common in Python and sometimes referred to as \"dunders,\" short for \"double underscores.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not all! `__init__()` also _must_ take a special argument as its first: `self`. This argument refers to the object being created, and you have to provide it to the constructor in order for it to work.\n",

We haven't made a `Vehicle` class, but if we did, `Car` migh well be a **subclass** of it. Python allows us to define super/sub classes and allow what's known as **inheritance**. Inheritance means subclasses can _inherit_ the properties/methods of their parents.\n",

We'll also create a `defang()` method that may be handy for safely passing indicators around to teammates and documentation.\n",
