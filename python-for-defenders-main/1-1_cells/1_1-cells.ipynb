    "We _assign_ values to variables with the `=` operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also notice there's a `: str` on there. That is a **type hint**. It tells us, the programmers, a little about the kind of data stored in the variable. In this case, the hint informs us that `name` contains a string, or `str`. Strings are text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, I want to be very clear: **TYPE HINTS ARE OPTIONAL!** The following would have worked just as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input(\"Hey! What's your name?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't care either way. So why use type hints? I am an advocate of type hints because they serve as in-line documentation. They help us understand what kinds of data we're working with as we go. Yeah it's a little more syntax, but I think the clarity is well worth it. And for this course, we'll be using type hints as a standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right of the `=` is a **function call**. The `input()` function is built into Python, and reads input from the user with the provided prompt. Functions are _called_ with the function name, parentheses, and any **arguments** to the function inside those parens. Once that function has executed, the resulting value is saved in `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Nice to meetcha, \" + name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the `print()` function to print our greeting. The greeting is a combination of 2 strings: `\"Nice to meetcha, \"` and our `name` variable. The `+` operator works on strings in Python as well as numbers. On strings, in _concatenates_, or joins, the strings together. That's why we left that extra space after the comma."
