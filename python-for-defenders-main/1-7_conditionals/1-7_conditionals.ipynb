    "Way back in 1-1, we covered the first of the **4 Fundamental Structures** of programming languages: variables. Then we went on a rather lengthy detour to discuss various data types. That was important base knowledge, but now we're ready to return to the 4 Structures with **Conditionals**.\n",

    "As we've seen, our programs and cells execute code instructions in order from top to bottom. But sometimes, we want to change it up depending on the situation. **Conditionals** allow us to test for particular circumstances and choose different code to execute depending on whether the test passes or fails. \n",
